What is letter naming fluency?

In a Letter Name Fluency (LNF) task, a student is given a random list of upper- and lowercase letters and has 1 minute to identify the names of as many letters as possible. Schools often use these scores to determine which students are at risk for reading difficulties.

Why is letter naming fluency important? 

Letter naming fluency is included in many assessments because it’s a great indicator of risk and a strong predictor of reading success. Letter-naming speed is the single most significant predictor for word reading ability for first-grade students. (Neuhaus & Swank, 2002).  

When children can recognize and name the letters of the alphabet accurately and automatically, they have a foundation for learning the alphabetic principle and learning to read. (Adams, 1994; Ehri, 2005)

Also, students who recognize letters with accuracy and speed have an easier time learning the sounds associated with them. (Adams, 1999)
